## Review

hw6: matrix

[repeat: embedded iteration](http://formandcode.com/code-examples/repeat-embedded) example from Form+Code


## Theory

- Conditional statements
- Bounds of a circle
- loading images: [Shiffman's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f0WEitGmiw), [Processing tutorial](https://processing.org/tutorials/pixels/)- read until "Pixels, pixels, and more pixels", starting from this one, there is advanced topics which we didn't introduce yet, like arrays and functions... don't get confused

## Practice 

step1: Bounds of a circle (bonus: synthesized sound, more info [here](https://processing.org/tutorials/sound/). more examples on sound under File->Examples->Libraries->Sound->Oscillators)
[circularButtonWithSound.pde](https://github.com/ixd-izmir/ixd3101f18/blob/master/src/circularButtonWithSound.pde)

step2: Motion - make the button move from left to right of the canvas

step3: Button disappears from the right edge, bring it back from the left

step4: Create multiple instances of the same circular button (with motion) using a for loop

step5: Change the position of the button randomly on the canvas and try to catch it with the mouse, increase the score
