## Interview

How to conduct an interview? (Google Ventures) [+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq3OiHQ-HCU)

**Basic methods**
* Interview where the interaction happen
* Avoid a fixed set of questions
* Assume the role of an apprentice, not an expert
* Use open-ended and closed-ended questions to direct the discussion
* Focus on goals first and tasks second
* Avoid making the user a designer
* Avoid discussing technology
* Encourage storytelling
* Ask for a show-and-tell
* Avoid leading questions

**Leading questions**
* Would feature X help you?
* You like X, don’t you?
* Do you think you’d use feature X if it were available?
* Does X seem like a good idea to you?
