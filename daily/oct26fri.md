## Interview

How to conduct an interview? (Google Ventures) [+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq3OiHQ-HCU)

**Basic methods**
* Interview where the interaction happen
* Start by introducing yourself briefly and ask for recording permission
* Avoid a fixed set of questions
* Assume the role of an apprentice, not an expert
* Use open-ended and closed-ended questions to direct the discussion
* Focus on goals first and tasks second
* Avoid making the user a designer
* Avoid discussing technology
* Encourage storytelling
* Ask for a show-and-tell
* Avoid leading questions

**Leading questions**
* Would feature X help you?
* You like X, don’t you?
* Do you think you’d use feature X if it were available?
* Does X seem like a good idea to you?

# Homework (Due: Oct 30, Tue 13:30)
1. **Coding**

Use three **for** loops and the text() function to draw the following to the screen: the numbers 0 to 40, counting up by 2; the numbers 100 to 1000, counting up by 100; the numbers 90 to 5, counting down by 5. Pay attention to the layout and typography, not only the numbers.

**Instructions**

*Prepare all the materials needed for the interview (methodological: questions, tasks; practical: camera, notepad, pen, smartphone)*

You will keep it short considering you are in a metro station and your interviewees are probably busy going somewhere.

Considering that you will record short interviews, try to conduct around 5 interviews.

Try to approach people from different age groups.

Try to approach people who seem to look less busy at that moment. Some people like to read, listen to music, talk on the phone while waiting for the metro, respect their time.

You've been working on the Kiosk already and you know how to use it. 

One of your group members should be the interviewer and the other should record the process. 

step1: Let the interviewee use the kiosk as they want and record the process.

step2: Define 2-3 tasks for the interviewees to accomplish, i.e. "assume that you need to go to a drugstore close to this metro stop, can you find it from the kiosk?" "let's say you have some free time this evening, can you check for some events to go that you are interested in?"... you are more knowledgable about the UI, please ask detailed questions that might lead for a good design proposal. Observe the interviewee carefully, and let them *think-aloud* the steps. Observe carefully if they struggle with the UI / interaction and observe their actions, take notes if necessary. Don't lead them. You might not be able to take notes during the observation, you will watch your recordings later for this purpose. 

Upload the interview(s) to YouTube as one cut.

step3: After you are done with your observations, sit down to watch/listen your recordings in detail. Report your observations on an A4. Highlight the keywords.
