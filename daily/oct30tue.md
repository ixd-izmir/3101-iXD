A reminder of the interview stages:

1 introduction “a friendly welcome”

2 context “demographics”

3 artifact discovery “the product”

4 task “think aloud”

5 debrief “interpretation”

## part1
step 1. create an **affinity diagram** and an **empathy map** after all the comments you've received in-class, all the data you've collected from the interviews you've conducted: [more info on this page](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-visualize-your-qualitative-user-research-results-for-maximum-impact) and [watch this video](https://www.careinnovations.org/resources/catalyst-method-affinity-clustering/) and [consider these questions](https://methods.18f.gov/interview-debrief/)

step 2. if you see that there are some flaws and you need more data please conduct more interviews. some of the groups already have to do new interviews, you must have received comments on slack

step 3. edit your **affinity diagram** and **empathy map** according to the results of all of the interviews.  

step 4. upload to project folder on Drive as **ixd3101f18_p1-3_affinity-diagram.pdf** and **ixd3101f18_p1-3_empathy-map.pdf**

## part2
Start creating your report of p1 using the InDesign template under Drive/[formats]
