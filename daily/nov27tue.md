## Practice

Research 101: Collecting research findings in a database format. Electrical Vehicle Charger Booking App database: **Drive/p3-SmartMove/EVC_BookingAppDb**

## Presentation of P3 Brief (Vestel)

Path to the comparative analysis presentation: **Drive/p3-SmartMove/VESTEL_EVCMobileApps_Benchmark_180622.pdf**

## Homework (Due: Dec 4, Tue 13.30)

1. Fill up the Electrical Vehicle Charger Booking app database that we've started creating in class according to your research findings. Path to the database: **Drive/p3-SmartMove/EVC_BookingAppDb**

2. Create a comparative analysis presentation as Vestel displayed in class based on your previous research. Your presentation should include 
 - Login Screen
 - Login Screen: Analysis
 - Main Screen
 - Main Screen: Analysis
 - Map Filters Screen
 - Map Filters Screen: Analysis 
 - Station Detail Screen
 - Station Details Screen: Analysis
 - Feature Comparison 
 - Flowmap (_for each app_) 
 
Please consider **both Android and iOS versions** of the apps. You can limit this work to 3 apps from your research that have the most # of downloads.

Analyse each screen in terms of UI elements on a separate analysis page (naming - **Main Screen: Analysis**): highlight and tag all UI elements (for Android and iOS separately) according to Google and Apple's terminology. Terminology for [Android](https://material.io/design/components/#) listed all under **components** section and for [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/interface-essentials/) listed all under **bars, views and controls** sections.

Upload to your project folder as **ixd3101f18_p3-2_Benchmark.pdf**
